This screensaver features Adinkra Symbols.
Adinkra are visual symbols that represent concepts, proverbs, and aphorisms. They originated from the Gyaman people of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Back then, they featured as prints on cloth which royals wore to important ceremonies. But they have transcended these Ghanaian and Ivorian origins. They now grace logos, clothing, furniture, architecture, and more. These new usages embody a global recognition of their profound cultural significance.
